-- Movie Database
-- This database features two entities (movies and actors) in a many-to-many relation. Each entity has its own table. A third table, casting , is used to link them. The relationship is many-to-many because each film features many actors and each actor has appeared in many films.
-- movie(id, title, yr, director, budget, gross)
-- actor(id, name)
-- casting(movieid, actorid, ord)
